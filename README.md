This project aims to create a summary report of the "Atlanta City Employee Salaries"[1] dataset using a preferable database and data orchestration tool.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Database - Google BigQuery
  *Seamlessly pull and process data with Google's BigQuery.
Orchestration Tool - Apache Airflow

BigQuery
  BigQuery is a serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse.

  Setup
    - Create a new project in Google Cloud Console and navigate to BigQuery.
    - Create a dataset called 'salaries' and a table using the dataset[1] provided and name as 'atlanta_salaries_report'.

  Data Processing
    - Using 'atlanta_salaries_report', create 'atlanta_salaries_report_filtered' by including entries with 0.95 percentile in annual salary and exclude who has 'Organization' includes 'Atlanta'. Preview of the table,

    - Using 'atlanta_salaries_report_filtered', create 'atlanta_salaries_report_filtered_summary' to be able to show the average salaries of women and men of different ages. Preview of the table,

   Python Scripts and BigQuery Authentication
    - To be able to run queries inside a Python Script, these steps should be followed,
      - Install the bigquery library -> pip install google-cloud-bigquery
      - Ensure that the path where google-cloud-bigquery is installed is on your PYTHONPATH. If not, add to PYTHONPATH. You can find the installation path with this command in Windows systems-> pip show google-cloud-bigquery | findstr Location
     After these steps if you try to run the code you will end up with 'google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError'
     To be able to resolve this issue, 
      - Set up Google Cloud SDK using official setup steps[2]
      - Create a service account from IAM&Admin Console and assign them given roles,

      - Then, run this command to finalize authentication:
       gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account <service_account_mail_address>
